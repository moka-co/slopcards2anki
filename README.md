`slopcards-to-anki` gives Claude/Gemini the ability to transform your **local markdown notes** into high-retention flashcards. It automatically uploads and syncs them to your local Anki profile. Perfect for **Obsidian** users.

## 🚀Features
- **Automatic Upload & Sync**: automatically breaks down complex notes into single-fact "atmoic" cards for maximum retention
- **LaTeX Support & STEM Ready**: Full support for inline `$math$` and block `$$math$$` notation, preserved perfectly for Anki's rendering engine
- **Smart Cloze Deletion**: Identifies definitions and sequences to generate cloze card dynamically
- **Supports both skill and MCP server**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a **local AI skill**. It is designed to run in environments where the AI has access to your local machine:
> - ✅ Supported: Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Aider, or **any local LLM agent with shell access**.
> - ❌ Not Supported: Standard web interfaces (claude.ai, gemini.google.com, chatgPT.com). These browser-based tools cannot communicate with your local Anki installation.


## 🛠️ Quick Start
### 1. Prerequisites
- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) must be installed and running
- [AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) Add on: Install code `2055492159` in anki (Tools > Add-ons > Get Add-ons)

### 2. Installation

#### As Skill (Suggested)
Instructions for Gemini
```
git clone https://github.com/moka-co/slopcards2anki.git
cd slopcard2anki
gemini skill link $PWD
```


#### As MCP
Instruction for Gemini (claude follows the same pattern):

Powershell:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/moka-co/slopcards2anki.git
cd slopcard2anki
gemini mcp add slopcards2anki "python3 -m uv run --project $PWD python -m mcp_server.mcp_server"       
```

Linux:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/moka-co/slopcards2anki.git
cd slopcard2anki
gemini mcp add slopcards2anki "python -m uv run --project $PWD python -m mcp_server.mcp_server"  
```


### 3. Usage
Once registered, you can use **natural language** to automatically upload flashcards. 

**Example Prompts**:
- "Convert my 'Calculus_Notes.md' into 30 atomic flashcards using slopcards-to-anki"
- "Find the Anki card about "Photosynthetis" and update the back with more detail from this paragraph."

If you installed the MCP server, type `/mcp` in your CLI to see available tools.

## 🏗️ How it works
1. The AI (e.g. Claude Code / Gemini CLI) analyzes your notes and identifies high-value concepts
2. The the AI calls the `main.py` or `mcp_server` tools to create or update cards to your local Anki profile

## ⚠️ Scope & Roadmap
- **Text & Math Focused**: currently optimized for text and LaTeX formulas.
- **Media Support**: Image and audio uploads are not currently supported (help is appreciated).
- **Format**: It has been tested with Markdown files, but it works with any file format that AI is capable of reading. However to get better result you may first want to use tools like [markitdown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown)
