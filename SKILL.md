#  Slopcard2Anki - Anki Flashcard Manager
This skill allows Claude/Gemini to read local files, distill them into high-quality flashcards, and sync them to Anki via a local `main.py` script.

## Operational Environment
This skill operates exclusively in a **local execution context**. It requires access to the host machine's filesystem to read/write CSV files and access to `localhost:8765` to communicate with AnkiConnect. If you are being executed in a cloud-hosted web sandbox (e.g., a browser-based chat interface), notify the user that you cannot reach their local Anki instance and recommend using a local CLI-based agent instead.

## Prerequisites
Ensure the environment has the necessary dependencies:
```shell
pip install requests psutil
```

## Card Creation Principles
When generating content, adhere to these "Gold Standard" SR (Spaced Repetition) rules:
To ensure high-quality cards, follow these rules when generating content:
- **Atomicity:** One card = one specific fact. Avoid "wall-of-text" answers
- **Clarity:** **bold** key terms for visual scanning.
- Follow Data sanization rules
- **Cloze Deletion**: some cards and concepts must be cloze e.g. Front: "The derivative of an exponential is \_\_\_\_" Back: "Another derivative". You can use Anki's Cloze format: "{{c1::hidden text}}". 
    - *Example:* "{{c1::Rome}} is the capital of Italy."
- **Formula Integrity:** If a formula is present, preserve it exactly using LaTeX syntax.
    - Use $inline math$ for small variables.
    - Use $$display math$$ for standalone equations.
- **The "Principle of Two-Way" (Optional):** For key formulas, generate two cards: 
   - Card A: Name/Concept -> Formula
   - Card B: Formula -> Concept/Variable definitions.
- **Contextual Wikilinks**: If a markdown file contains [[wikilinks]], generate at least one question that references the linked concept (reading the linked file if available)
- **Output:** Write the flashcards into a temporary .csv file.

## Data Sanization
To ensure the CLI parses the data correctly, you **must**:
- **No Headers**: do **not** include "Front, Back" headers rows in the CSV
- **Escaping**: escape double quotes by doubling them ("").
- **Newlines**: replace internal newlines with <br>
- **LaTeX**: ensure LaTeX backslashes (\\) are preserved and not treated as escape characters by the CLI.

## CSV Format Required
The `main.py` script expects a standard CSV with a header row. Use this structure:
```csv
"What is the capital of France?", "Paris"
"{{c1::Rome}} is the capital of Italy", "and the most populated municipality of Italy"
```

- The first field is the `front` that is the question or the prompt
- The second field is the `back` that is the answer or explanation



## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1 - Generate flashcards and upload 
When a user provides a file or text and asks for "flashcards", follow these steps:
1. **Analyze:** Read the source file/text provided by the user.
2. **Extract:** extract concepts suitable for Spaced Repetition.
3. **Sanitize**: apply the [[Data Sanization]] rules above
3. **Generate CSV:** Create a temporary file (e.g., `tmp_cards.csv`) using the format defined below.
4. **Execute:** Run `python3 main.py --f tmp_cards.csv --deck_name "Target Deck"`.
5. **Clean up:** Delete the temporary CSV file after a successful run.

**Constraint**: if generating <100 cards, **do not** write a Python script to build the CSV; directly output the raw CSV data to a file.

### Workflow 2 - Import
To import an **existing** CSV file:
```shell
main.py --f file_name.csv --deck_name "Deck Name"
```
*Note:* if no deck name is provided, prompt the user for one. Never assume the deck name.

## Workflow 3 - Search & Discovery
To find a flashcard by keyword:
```
main.py --find_note "search term"
```

Returns:
- CARD ID (needed for updates)
- Front text
- Back text

If multiple flashcards match, review the returned text to identify the correct flashcard.

### Workflow 4: Update Flashcards
1. **Search**: find the ID via `main.py --find_note` follow instruction from [[Workflow 3 - Search & Discovery]]
2. Review the return back text and improve it by adding additional context
    - You may ask the user for a file where to look for additional context
3. **Update**: 
```shell
main.py --update_note_by_id CARD_ID --new_front_text "New front" --new_back_text "New back"
```

*Note* you can also include only one of the back/front arguments e.g. to update only back: `main.py --update_note_by_id CARD_ID --new_back_text "Better back text"`

## Troubleshooting
Always notify the user of any error you encounter.

**If Anki is not reachable/running**
1. Attempt auto-launch with this exact command: `main.py --try_launch_anki`
2. If auto-launch fails, notice the user and ask him to start Anki.

**If flashcard not found**
- Try broader search terms
- Check if card exists in the correct deck
- Ask the user for what to do

**On Windows:**
Default to `python3 main.py` if the standard `python main.py` fails.

**Important**: always report the CLI output to the user to confirm the action was successful
