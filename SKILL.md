#  Slopcard2Anki - Anki Flashcard Manager
This skill allows Claude/Gemini to read local files, distill them into high-quality flashcards, and sync them to Anki via a local `main.py` script.

## Core Workflow
When a user asks to "make flashcards" from a file or text, follow these steps:
1. **Analyze:** Read the source file/text provided by the user.
2. **Extract:** Identify key concepts suitable for Spaced Repetition.
3. **Generate CSV:** Create a temporary file (e.g., `tmp_cards.csv`) using the format defined below.
4. **Execute:** Run `python3 main.py --f tmp_cards.csv --deck_name "Target Deck"`.
5. **Clean up:** Delete the temporary CSV file after a successful run.

## Card Creation Principles 
To ensure high-quality cards, follow these rules when generating content:
- **Atomicity:** One card = one specific fact. Do not cram whole paragraphs into the 'back'.
- **Clarity:** Use bold text for key terms.
- Follow Data sanization rules
- **Cloze Deletion**: some cards and concepts must be cloze e.g. Front: "The derivative of an exponential is \_\_\_\_" Back: "Another derivative". You can use Anki's Cloze format: "{{c1::hidden text}}". 
    - *Example Front:* "The derivative of an exponential is {{c1::another derivative}}."
- **Formula Integrity:** If a formula is present, preserve it exactly using LaTeX syntax.
    - Use $formula$ for inline math.
    - USE $$formula$$ for display style math
- **The "Principle of Two-Way" (Optional):** For key formulas, create two cards: 
   - Card A: Name/Concept -> Formula
   - Card B: Formula -> Name/Concept/Variable definitions.
- **Context through wikilinks**: if a markdown file has wikilink, generate atleast 1 question that recall that wikilinked argument (reading the wikilinked reference!), make sure the note make sense in the context of the note
- **Output:** Write the flashcards into a temporary .csv file.

### Data Sanization
- Ensure LaTeX backslashes (\\) are preserved and not treated as escape characters by the CLI.
- Replace internal newlines with <br>
- Escape double quotes by doubling them ("").

## Constraints
When you are creating less than 100 cards, do not create Python script when creating the CSV file. Directly output the raw CSV data to the file.

### CSV Format Required
The `main.py` script expects a standard CSV with a header row. Use this structure:
```csv
front, back
"What is the capital of France?", "Paris"
```


## Add flashcards from a CSV file
Import flashcards from a CSV file:
`main.py --f file_name.csv --deck_name "Deck Name"`

**CSV format required**:
- `front`: The question or prompt
- `back`: The answer or explanation

If the user doesn't specify a deck name, ask them which deck to use. Never assume the deck name.

## Searching for flashards
Find a flashcard by keyword:
`main.py --find_note "search term"`

Returns:
- CARD ID (needed for updates)
- Front text
- Back text

If multiple flashcards match, review the returned text to identify the correct flashcard.

## Updating cards

Update an existing flashcard using its ID::
- To update front: `main.py --update_note_by_id CARD_ID --new_front_text "Updated fresh new front text"`
- To update back: `main.py --update_note_by_id CARD_ID --new_back_text "Better back text"`
- To update both: include both `--new_front_text` and `--new_back_text` flags

To update both use:
```bash
main.py --update_note_by_id CARD_ID --new_front_text "New front" --new_back_text "New back"
```

**Workflow for enhancing an existing cards:**
1. Search for the flashcard: `main.py --find_note "keyword"`
2. Review existing back text
3. Generate improved back text with additional context, you may ask the user where to look for context
4. Update `main.py --update_note_by_id CARD_ID --new_back_text "Enhanced text with extra context"`

Ensure that the script runned correctly by checking the output. Notice the user of any output you see.

## Troubleshooting
Always notify the user of any error you encounter.

**If Anki is not running**
1. Run this exact command `main.py --check_anki` and **WAIT** 3 to 5 seconds
2. Attempt auto-launch with this exact command: `main.py --try_launch_anki`
3. If auto-launch fails, notice the user and ask him to start Anki.

**If flashcard not found**
- Try broader search terms
- Check if card exists in the correct deck
- Ask the user for what to do

**On Windows:**
Use `python3 main.py` instead of `python main.py` if you encounter errors.
